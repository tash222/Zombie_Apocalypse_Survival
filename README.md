# ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE SURVIVAL

## Overview
This is a third-person shooter game where the player must survive three waves of zombies. If all zombies are eliminated, the player wins the game. The game features a custom-designed map built using components and blueprints from FAP, while the character, zombie movements, and gun mechanics were integrated by us.

## Features
- *Third-Person Shooter Mechanics*: Smooth and responsive controls for aiming and shooting.
- *Three Waves of Zombies*: Increasing difficulty as the game progresses.
- *Custom Map*: Designed using FAP components and blueprints.
- *Custom Character & Zombie Movement*: Integrated movement logic for both the player and enemies.
- *Gun Mechanics*: Implemented shooting system with animations and effects.
- *Zombie Chase Behavior*: If the player is within a certain radius, zombies start running toward them.
- *Aim Down Sight Mechanic*: When aiming down sights, the camera snaps to a closer position for better precision.
- *Dark Themed Map & Torch Mechanic*: The map is designed to be dark to enhance the horror theme. A torch is attached to the player, shortening the line of sight, increasing difficulty, and adding jump scares.
- *Made in Unreal Engine*: Developed using Unreal Engine for high-quality graphics and gameplay.
- *Collaborative Development*: The map was created on one laptop, while character movement was developed on another, and both were merged in the end, which was a challenging process.
